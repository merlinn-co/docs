# MongoDB

This guide shows you how to integrate Vespper with MongoDB.

## Overview

Vespper can access your MongoDB database and query contextual information from it that might be relevant for an active investigation.

## Prerequisites

- Working environment with an organization. If you don't have one, head over to the [setup](../02-Getting%20started/01-Setup%20Vespper.md) page.

## Setup

Follow these steps to connect Vespper to MongoDB:

1. Inside your organization settings, go to "Integrations".
2. Locate the "MongoDB" integration and click "Add".
3. In the modal, insert your MongoDB DB URI.
4. Click "Connect"

That's it! You can now talk to Vespper about your database.
