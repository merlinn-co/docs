# Support & feedback

In order of preference the best way to communicate with us:

- **Slack**: community support. Click [here](https://vespper.com/#community) to join.
- **GitHub Discussions**: Contribute ideas, support requests and report bugs (preferred as there is a static & permanent for other community members).
- **Privately**: contact at support@vespper.com
